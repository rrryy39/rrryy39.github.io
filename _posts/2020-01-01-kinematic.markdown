Kinematic snake runs into singular configurations when the nonholonomic constraints are violated (e.g. one or more of the constraint equations becomes a linear combination of the others), at which point the matrix inverse becomes analytically unsolvable and thus causing discontinuities. We propose an optimization algorithm for finding high-efficient gait of nonholonomic kinematic snake that purposely enclose the singularity region, which ultimately produces the best gaits given specified input energy cost functions.
