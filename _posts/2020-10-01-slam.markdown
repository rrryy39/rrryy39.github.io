Our Goal is developing an in-pipe localization and mapping strategy which can be modularly deployed to any in-pipe service robot or mobile system. Task 1 establishes a minimum viable software framework that serves as the foundation for the Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithms and other supporting software architecture for in-pipe mapping and inspection applications. Task 2 provides a development path to create a minimum viable product of the proposed sensor prototype hardware and its interfacing software that enables heterogeneous sensory information fusion.
